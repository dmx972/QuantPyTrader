			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Build Multi-Source Market Data Pipeline",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the multi-source data pipeline implementation into: 1) Base fetcher abstract class and rate limiting infrastructure, 2) Individual fetcher implementations for each data source (Alpha Vantage, Polygon, Yahoo Finance, crypto exchanges), 3) Data normalization and standardization layer, 4) Automatic failover and redundancy system, 5) Redis caching layer implementation, 6) WebSocket connection management and reconnection logic, 7) Data aggregation and deduplication service, 8) Real-time streaming infrastructure, 9) Historical data backfill system, 10) Comprehensive testing suite for each component",
			"reasoning": "This task involves complex asynchronous programming, multiple API integrations, WebSocket management, failover logic, and caching. Each data source has unique APIs and data formats requiring individual attention. The failover mechanism and real-time streaming add significant complexity."

		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Core Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) Algorithm",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Implement the UKF algorithm in stages: 1) Mathematical foundations and parameter initialization system, 2) Sigma point generation with numerical stability checks, 3) Unscented transformation implementation, 4) State prediction mechanism with nonlinear dynamics, 5) Measurement update and Kalman gain calculation, 6) Covariance management and regularization techniques, 7) Numerical stability improvements (Cholesky, SVD fallbacks), 8) Comprehensive unit tests and validation against reference implementations",
			"reasoning": "The UKF is mathematically complex requiring deep understanding of nonlinear filtering, matrix operations, and numerical stability. Implementation requires careful attention to numerical precision, covariance positive-definiteness, and computational efficiency. This is the mathematical foundation for the entire BE-EMA-MMCUKF system."

		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Six Market Regime Models and Multiple Model Framework",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 12,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create the multi-regime system incrementally: 1) Abstract regime model base class and interfaces, 2) Bull market model with GBM dynamics, 3) Bear market model with negative drift, 4) Mean reversion/sideways model with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, 5) High volatility regime with GARCH-like dynamics, 6) Low volatility regime implementation, 7) Crisis mode model with extreme parameters, 8) Markov chain transition matrix and validation, 9) Multiple model framework with parallel filter bank, 10) Likelihood calculation and Bayesian regime probability updates, 11) State fusion across regimes, 12) Performance optimization and testing suite",
			"reasoning": "This requires implementing six different stochastic processes, each with unique dynamics and parameters. The multiple model framework adds complexity with parallel execution, likelihood calculations, and probabilistic fusion. The Markov chain transitions and regime detection are sophisticated components requiring careful calibration."

		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Bayesian Missing Data Compensation and EMA",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Build the Bayesian estimation and EMA system: 1) Beta distribution parameter tracking and updates, 2) Reception rate estimation with confidence intervals, 3) Missing data detection and compensation logic, 4) Adaptive covariance inflation during data gaps, 5) Expected Mode Augmentation with dynamic regime calculation, 6) Integration testing with the main Kalman filter framework",
			"reasoning": "While mathematically sophisticated, this task is more focused than tasks 4 and 5. The Beta distribution updates are straightforward, but the integration with the UKF and handling edge cases (extended data gaps) requires careful implementation. The EMA adds moderate complexity with weighted regime calculations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Create State Persistence and Recovery System",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Implement robust state management: 1) State serialization for numpy arrays and complex objects, 2) Database storage schema and ORM integration, 3) Checkpoint file system with rotation policy, 4) State validation and integrity checks, 5) Recovery mechanisms for corrupted states, 6) Performance optimization for large state objects, 7) Integration tests for save/load cycles across different scenarios",
			"reasoning": "State persistence is conceptually straightforward but requires careful handling of serialization formats, database transactions, and error recovery. The checkpoint system and validation logic add moderate complexity. Performance considerations for large matrices are important but manageable."

		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Build Comprehensive Backtesting Engine with Regime Analysis",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 11,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create the backtesting system progressively: 1) Core backtesting engine architecture and interfaces, 2) Portfolio management and position tracking, 3) Transaction cost and slippage models, 4) Standard performance metrics calculation, 5) Walk-forward analysis implementation, 6) Missing data simulation system, 7) Regime-specific metrics and analysis, 8) Filter-specific performance metrics, 9) Trade execution simulation with realistic constraints, 10) Results storage and reporting system, 11) Comprehensive testing with historical data",
			"reasoning": "Backtesting engines are complex with many moving parts: portfolio management, cost models, metrics calculations, and walk-forward analysis. The regime-aware components and filter-specific metrics add unique complexity. Accurate simulation of real trading conditions requires careful attention to detail."

		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement FastAPI Backend and Real-time WebSocket Communication",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "Build the API layer systematically: 1) FastAPI application setup with CORS and middleware, 2) JWT authentication and authorization system, 3) RESTful endpoints for strategy CRUD operations, 4) WebSocket implementation for real-time market data, 5) Socket.IO integration for bidirectional communication, 6) Redis pub/sub for real-time updates, 7) Celery integration for async task processing, 8) API documentation and OpenAPI schema, 9) Load testing and performance optimization",
			"reasoning": "While FastAPI simplifies API development, integrating WebSockets, Socket.IO, authentication, and Celery adds complexity. Real-time communication requires careful handling of connections, disconnections, and state synchronization. The async nature requires proper error handling and testing."

		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Streamlit Dashboard and Visualization Interface",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create the UI incrementally: 1) Main dashboard layout and navigation structure, 2) Authentication and session management, 3) Real-time portfolio metrics and P&L display, 4) Interactive regime visualization charts, 5) Kalman filter state vector plots with confidence bands, 6) Strategy configuration interface, 7) Backtesting control panel and results visualization, 8) WebSocket integration for live updates, 9) Dark theme styling and responsive design, 10) Performance optimization for large datasets",
			"reasoning": "Streamlit development is relatively straightforward, but creating professional-grade visualizations with real-time updates, complex charts (regime evolution, state vectors with confidence bands), and maintaining session state adds complexity. The integration with WebSockets and handling large datasets requires optimization."
